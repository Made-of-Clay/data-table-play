# Data Table Play

This project will serve 2 purposes:

1. try building a basic data table with enough functionality that it's not terribly contrived (so I can experiment with implementation details of various frameworks/approaches)
2. experiment with agent mode Copilot to see how reliably it can set up a relatively complex project with clear (enough) requirements

Data tables are always fairly complex, and I want to test both performance, DX (dev experience), and the basics of different libraries (e.g. React, Solid, Svelte, etc. I know Vue pretty well already) to get more hands-on with how they compare/contrast.
